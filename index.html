      <p>
        A 24 software eng. student with ADHD and probably more undiagnosed
        mental illnesses. I have a cute little kitty called
        <b>Karkosha</b> (she's not a kitten actually like 7 yo and sick with
        asthma and FIP so her nose basically doesn't work).

      <h2>What I Do in My (free) Time:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bedrot.</li>
        <li>Everything that comes out of bedrot.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What I'm Trying To Do Here:</h2>
      <p>
        This is gonna be a personal project that I'm making during the summer
        break of my second year in uni (with the help of my brother) and
        hopefully look back at it later in the future and laugh about it.
      </p>
      <h2>The Current Phase in My Life:</h2>
      <p>
        Since I go in and out of different phases in my life, and by that I mean
        the things I like and spend time doing currently. I'm mostly watching
        only anime like all the damn time (note from brother: cringe.) and I
        feel like I can't watch anything live action anymore because it ruined
        me? I also started reading manga, which is something I never thought I
        would do. but it's quite fun tbh. Me and Dodi are playing Wordle
        everyday. I'm on a 35 day streak and have been getting it in less tries
        than him most of the time (note from brother: ISTG SHE LIKE CHEATS ALL
        THE TIME ITS INSANE). I've been drinking match and iced coffee all the
        time. Match is really interesting and fun I didn't think I would like it
        as much as I did. I'm trying to go back to reading but I'm just too lazy
        I guess. Megan Thee Stallion released a song rapping about being a hot
        nerdu girl and I'm here for it. Oh, My fav anime is JJK and I was able
        to get my brother hooked on it as well even though he really hates
        anime. Also I'm lame and I like SPORTS? although it's only F1. A little
        while back we played a silly little cowboy game called RDR2 and it
        wasn't just a silly little cowboy game and I still think about arthur
        every day it hurts sometimes. Kendrick and Drake had a rap battle. Drake
        lost. obvi.
      </p>
      <p>That was.. a lot.</p>
